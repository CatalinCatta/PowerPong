### About the Project:

- The purpose of this project is to create a modern version of the classic Pong game, adding power-ups and debuffs to make the gameplay more dynamic and challenging. With customizable graphics and sound effects, this game aims to provide a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages and skill levels.
